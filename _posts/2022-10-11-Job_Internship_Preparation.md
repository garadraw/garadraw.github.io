Alongside Tim Gerdes we Initiated and Organised the student led Job/Internship Preparation Program, in which we helped students create a professional image, project which inspired the creation of a Curriculum project at 42 Wolfsburg, the 42 Intra Project named Professional Portfolio.

HARD SKILLS: Coding Challenges Specific for Interviews

Interview Preparation
- Role Playing(Students play the Role of the Interviewer and the Interviewee thus Exercising their Interview Skills and also getting to Know how the Other Side(HR) Thinks as well)

We Walked Students through all of the Steps Needed for them to Successfully Land an Internship or Job by
holding Workshop Weeks dedicated for one Subject (IE: Creating a CV) in which the Participants Spend One Hour Per day Sharing and Learning from Each other (Peer2Peer) on the Subject, and at the End of it, in One Week, have a Working Product (a CV, a GithubAccount, a LinkedInAccount, etc).”
