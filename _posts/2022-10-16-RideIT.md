# ** Ride IT! **

As part of Student Council at 42 Wolfsburg the First Project Initiated was Ride IT!
Empowering Sustainable Mobility and Exponentially Offsetting our Carbon Footprint by Recycling Plastic and Glass Bottles and then Using the Funds to Acquire Used Bikes, put at the Disposal of the Students to Freely Use as they Desire, be it Day or Night.

For Students by Students
