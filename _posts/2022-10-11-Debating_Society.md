Celebrating One Year of Free Speech, Loads of Fun, Broad and Multifaceted Views, as well as Empowering of Strong Minded Individuals with Empathetic Characters.

We started out small during Corona times in the Virtual School, 2 People joined the first Debate

As time Passed we grew in size and also in the manner we gathered, from the Virtual School we went into Meeting Rooms and then the Society's home, 42 Wolfsburg Event Space

One Year has Passed since we have Created the Debating Society at #42Wolfsburg as part of the Project Scholarship Program.

Most Notable Events:
- School Debate on Implementing 2G or 3G in School, Debate of which I am More Than Proud of, as we Feel like it had a Very Big Impact on the School’s Policy to Not Implement 2G rules in School and thus Not Exclude any Students.
- We Debated alongside Open AI’s GPT3 – Da Vinci Model
- Debate between Max Senges(CEO of 42 Wolfsburg), Thomas Bornheim(CEO of 42 Heilbronn) and the Students of #42Heilbronn and #42Wolfsburg

Governance:
We have Listened and Applied the Will of the Members over our Structure, Rules, Culture and Governance through 2 Voting Forms, one every 6 Months.

I am also Proud to Announce that even though the Scholarship Project has Ended the Debating Society will Not End, and it will Go On out of Pure Pleasure, hopefully Continue Creating, Encouraging and Empowering Strong Minded Individuals with Good Communication Skills, Interesting Philosophical Views and Empathetic Characters.
