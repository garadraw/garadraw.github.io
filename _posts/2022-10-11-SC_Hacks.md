# **SC Hacks**

![img-description](/assets/img/SC_Hacks/01_SC_Hacks_Logo.png)

Alongside my dear Student Council colleagues, Kristiyana Milcheva, Karla Heinz, Vincent Heymans , Kacper Pucylo, we have launched SC Hacks Hackhaton in which 42 Wolfsburg Students are welcomed to find a solution for a bike lending tracking system.

Since the idea and prototype will probably hold Digital as well as Mechanical Developing we have benefited from two inspiring presentations:

Lars Mühlenstädt - Pertinent Technologies: Databases, Protocols, Libraries, Frameworks
Cristina Andreea Ionescu – FabLab Tips and Tricks

Many thanks to our speakers, as they have enlarged the participants technological horizons, inspiring and helping them to create and develop their ideas, as well as to Max Senges for Speaking in the Opening of SC Hacks.


Why did we create SC Hacks?

Around 3 months ago we acquired and deployed a fleet of bikes that the students can use freely and at their leisure, all made financially possible by recycling plastic, glass and metal.
We are very happy that the service, RIDE IT! we called it, has become most popular throughout the student body, however some of the bikes took too long to return.
Therefore we organised this Hackathon to find and develop a solution for a transparent usage of the bikes with which we hope that will insure and a fair and empathetic usage by keeping an open record of the bikes usage.

In short, make social transactions between us more fair with the use of technology.

Even though student council budget is very small we have also a cash prize for the winning team, as our logic behind our actions is as follows:

Students are getting paid while learning and working on a product that will insure the continuation of a free service that themselves benefit from.

In a nutshell, they are working for themselves.


The Final was Won by Edvinas Momkus

Edvinas implemented a system which holds both electronic and software elements:
He built a mechanical locker box, that holds the bike lock keys, controlled by a microcontroller which communicates with a personal website in which the students can log in by using their school credentials in order to receive the keys for the bikes.

A few words about Edvinas:
Seeking to further his personal development and further his computer science education, Edvinas relocated to Germany and joined #42wolfsburg last year. He has a flair for DIY and had previously studied electrical engineering.
