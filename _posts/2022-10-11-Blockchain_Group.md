# **42 Dapps and 42 Blockchain Alliance**

Co-created and co-organized the Blockchain Learning Group, 42 Dapps alongside Evangelos Espyromi at 42 Wolfsburg.
We Invited External Speakers from Companies dealing with Distributed Ledger Technologies and held weekly events and Explored together both on-line and on-site events made by Companies and from DAOs.

After a couple of months, we tied our relations to other students from other 42 campuses, and with Ihab Hormi (42 Abu Dhabi) and Alexa (42 Mulhouse) we decided to unite the blockchain learning groups across the 42 campuses from all over the world.


Thus toghether we grew the community from holding 42 Wob Students to being comprised of Students from across the 42 world and even IT Industry Experts representing their DAOs or Startups.
